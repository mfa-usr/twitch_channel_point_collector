Twitch Channel Point Collector is designed to be a standalone software that can run at an individual level but will eventually also be integrated into my discord bot dRobo (https://github.com/mfa-usr/dRobo.git) for multi-user use.

Simply put - it is a bot that collects Twitch channel points for you.

### As of 09-01-2023 this is a currently UNFINISHED project and not ready for use.

## Where I am at & Challenges:

09-01-2023 Worked on getting the offset of the channel points button. I am getting an error with Selenium not detecting Firefox and instead attempting to use Chrome libraries. Attempted to resolve with setting a relative path to the Firefox driver. Still getting               errors. </br>
08-31-2023 Pushed initial code. Looking into Twitch API on how to handle OAuth requests to collect channel points on the User's behalf.

## Audit Log:

09-01-2023  Fixed errors on 'cp_collect.py' Added: 'cp_info.txt', 'cp_launcher.bat', 'cp_offset.py' </br>
08-31-2023  Initial Push
