Twitch Channel Point Collector is designed to be a standalone software that can run at an individual level but will eventually also be integrated into my discord bot dRobo (https://github.com/mfa-usr/dRobo.git) for multi-user use.

Simply put - it is a bot that collects Twitch channel points for you.


## Where I am at & Challenges:
